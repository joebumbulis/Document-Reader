## Day 32: Confirming actions


* Path: Frontend - Austin - Spring 2017  Unit: React
* Practice using state with React

### Explorer Mode

* Using a fresh clone of the webpack-starter
* Create a document reader app, that allows users to read a document and mark that document as read.
* Use a checkbox to allow a user to mark a document as read
* When the user checks the checkbox, it should become checked AND they should be prompted to confirm whether they truly read the document (perhaps with a modal)
* If they confirm, the box should remain checked AND become disabled.
* If they cancel, the box should go back to being unchecked.
* This app should be using multiple react components.
* This app should be using the Redux architecture.
    * Reducer/Actions

### WHAT TO SUBMIT

  *  In the Notes section, include a link to your project live on the internet
